Nomo Miso Privacy Policy
nomomisoteam@gmail.com

Nomo Miso is a real-time audio tool that dampens background sound while keeping speech clear. We take privacy seriously and designed the app to process sound **on your device**.

## What We Collect
- **Microphone access (on-device only).** Audio is processed locally. **We do not upload or store microphone audio on our servers.**
- **App diagnostics & crash data.** Basic performance, stability, and purchase events (e.g., subscription status) to operate and improve the app. These may be collected via Apple frameworks (e.g., App Store / Crash reports) and/or our service providers listed below.
- **Purchase information.** We receive non-card details from Apple to confirm your subscription (product, term, and status). Apple processes payment.

> If we introduce optional analytics or cloud features later, this policy will be updated and such features will be opt-in.

## What We Do **Not** Collect
- No raw microphone recordings sent to our servers.
- No contact list, photos, or precise location.
- No health records or sensitive personal data.

## How We Use Information
- Operate core features (subscription entitlements, in-app functionality).
- Fix bugs, measure performance, and improve audio quality.
- Prevent abuse and comply with legal obligations.

## Sharing & Service Providers
We may use privacy-respecting providers for analytics, crash reporting, and subscription management. These providers act as **processors** on our behalf and only process data necessary to provide their services. We do not sell personal information.

_Current providers (update as needed):_
- Apple (App Store, payment processing, crash/analytics aggregated via Apple tools)

## Data Retention
- Diagnostic/analytics data: kept only as long as needed for the purposes above.
- Purchase/entitlement records: retained as required for tax, accounting, and fraud prevention.

## Your Choices
- **Permissions.** You can disable the microphone in iOS Settings → Privacy → Microphone (the app will not function without it).
- **Subscriptions.** Manage or cancel via iOS: Settings → [your name] → Subscriptions.
- **Access/Deletion requests.** Email **[Email]**. If we hold any personal data about you, we will respond per applicable law.

## Security
We use reasonable technical and organizational measures. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## Children
Nomo Miso is not intended for children under 13. If you believe a child provided data, contact nomomisoteam@gmail.com.

## International Users
Your data may be processed in your country of residence and where our providers operate. By using the app, you consent to such processing consistent with this policy.

## Changes to This Policy
We’ll post updates here and revise the “Last updated” date. Material changes will be highlighted in-app or on our site.
